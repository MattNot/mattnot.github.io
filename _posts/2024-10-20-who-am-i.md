### Hi!
I'm Matteo Notaro *(he/him)*  an italian guy that has an orrible passion. I like programming, problem solving and quite 
everything tech-related. Like üçï and ‚òï.

Jokes aside, I graduated in Computer Science (BCs) at [University of Calabria](https://informatica.unical.it/) in the 2020 (yeah, in the middle of a global pandemic, that sucks) and started to attend
the MCs in [Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://informatica.unical.it/insegnamenti/magistrale2020-2021), later dropped to end the MCs @ UniMarconi in Computer Engineering.

I've got my first low-budget jobs when I was at highschool, computer science too. Nothing to be proud, just a bunch of 
wordpress ~~developing~~. 

In the 2019 I obtained an Erasmus+ Traineeship (3 months) that I spent in the beautiful city of Klagenfurt am W√∂rthersee in Austria.
There I started my BCs thesis developing a parser for an answer set programming language, things that you study
and then let die in your mind. You know, good to know, but I can live without too. I was unhappy with the results of this
work, so I asked my professor to integrate with something more challenging. [I built an entire IDE as Service](https://github.com/MattNot/ASPIDEaS) for that programming language.
Results? 110 with Laude/110. That IDE is something that I'm proud and one day I'll rewrite some parts that today with more
experience can be done better.

Before getting graduated I've done some other low budget jobs just to get more confident with the industry.

In Sept. 2020 (yeah, global pandemic ü§ò) one of my professor asked me if I wanted to start working in one of the University of Calabria
spin-offs. I said yes and after 4 months of part-time job I resigned to apply to another company as a full-time developer.

I started my career as a full stack web developer, mostly Angular - Spring Boot and SQL databases. In that company I've also been introduced to (and worked with) Big Data topics and tools like Apache Spark, Scala, NO-SQL databases and so on, continuing to do web dev with angular, react, spring boot and quarkus.

With some self-study I learnt also DevOps utilities like Docker, K8s, Jenkins and other tools like Sonarqube, 
various identity server providers, AWS products... Too many things to be listed.

In that company one day I proposed an artificial intelligence product to create synthetic data based on production ones.
That project later became [DataGan](https://datagan.io) but now I really don't know if they are still running it.

After 2 years in that company I managed to became Head of R&D but unfortunately it was just a fancy name for "the guy who worked in all the projects in that area and gives tasks to others". After realizing that, I changed company and now I'm "just" a AI Specialist doing AI stuff.
