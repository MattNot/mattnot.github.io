# The gap

As a "baby" computer scientist (or software engineer) or someone about to choose this career, you might feel overwhelmed by the sheer firepower of these new LLMs.  

The real gap, however, lies in experience, not in firepower.  

These LLMs have seen millions, if not billions, of lines of code—probably at least three orders of magnitude more than the amount of code you will encounter in the next 40 years of your career.  

Surely, they must have better solutions than anything you could ever come up with, right? Not quite. Let me explain.

## Professional Intuition vs Algorithmic Responses

When we talk about professional intuition versus algorithmic responses, we're addressing a fundamental difference in how humans and LLMs approach programming challenges. Let me break this down in detail.

## Professional Intuition in Software Development

Professional intuition in software development is like a sixth sense that developers cultivate over years of hands-on experience. Imagine a senior developer who, within minutes of looking at a bug report, can narrow down the likely cause not because they've memorized every line of code, but because they've developed a deep understanding of how systems typically fail. This intuition comes from a rich tapestry of experiences: the late-night debugging sessions, the production incidents that required quick thinking, and the countless conversations with users and stakeholders.

Consider this real-world scenario: A system suddenly starts experiencing intermittent performance issues. An LLM, when presented with the error logs and code snippets, might suggest various optimization techniques based on pattern matching from its training data. However, a seasoned developer might immediately suspect an interaction with a recent business event—perhaps a marketing campaign that changed user behavior patterns—because they understand the broader context in which the code operates.

## Key Aspects of Professional Intuition

This intuition manifests in several key ways:

### Understanding System Behavior Under Stress
Through experience, developers develop an almost instinctive sense of how systems behave under different conditions. They can often predict cascade failures before they happen, not because they've calculated every possibility, but because they've developed a deep understanding of system dependencies and potential failure points.

### Context-Aware Problem Solving
When developers debug issues, they don't just look at the code in isolation. They consider factors like recent deployments, user behavior patterns, business events, and even the time of year (think holiday season traffic spikes). This holistic view is something that LLMs, despite their vast knowledge, cannot replicate because they lack real-world operational context.

### Risk Assessment
Perhaps most importantly, developers have an innate sense of risk that comes from real consequences. They understand that every line of code they write could potentially affect real users, business operations, and system stability. This understanding isn't just theoretical—it’s deeply personal and comes from experiencing both successes and failures.

## A Concrete Example

Imagine developing a payment processing system. An LLM might suggest perfectly valid code for handling transactions, complete with error handling and logging. However, a developer with experience in financial systems would instinctively add additional safeguards against double-charging, implement idempotency patterns, and ensure proper reconciliation mechanisms—not because these were explicitly requested, but because experience has taught them these are critical in financial systems.

## The Role of LLMs in Development

This doesn't mean LLMs aren't valuable—quite the opposite. When we understand that LLMs are pattern-matching tools rather than intuitive problem solvers, we can better leverage their strengths while relying on our intuition for the crucial decisions that require deep understanding and context. The key is recognizing that our intuition isn't threatened by LLMs but rather becomes more valuable as it helps us better utilize these tools.

## Strengthening Professional Intuition

The development of this professional intuition is ongoing and actually accelerates when working with LLMs. While the AI can handle routine coding tasks, we can focus on developing our understanding of system architectures, business domains, and user needs—areas where human intuition remains irreplaceable.
